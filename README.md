# Sales Forecasting for a Fast Food Chain

## Overview
This project aims to forecast monthly sales for a well-known fast-food chain using historical sales data. The primary focus is on implementing time series analysis and forecasting techniques to understand sales patterns and predict future trends.

## Data Description
The analysis uses historical sales data, which includes monthly sales figures, transaction counts, and other relevant metrics. For confidentiality, specific data figures are not disclosed in this documentation.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
The data was preprocessed to format the date columns correctly and set them as the index of the time series. This step ensured that the data was ready for time series analysis.

### Time Series Decomposition
We employed time series decomposition to understand underlying patterns in the sales data. This approach helped us segregate the trend, seasonality, and irregular components of the sales time series.

### ARIMA Model
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models were used for forecasting. The model parameters were carefully selected based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to ensure the best fit for the data. The chosen model aimed to capture the inherent seasonality and trends observed in the historical data.

### Model Fitting and Validation
The selected ARIMA model was fitted to the data, and its performance was validated. The validation process involved comparing the model's predictions against actual sales data. The model demonstrated a good fit, capturing key trends and seasonal variations in the sales data.

### Forecasting
The final model was used to forecast future sales. The forecasts provided insights into expected sales trends and highlighted periods of high and low sales activity. These predictions are valuable for strategic planning and resource allocation.

## Conclusion
The time series analysis and ARIMA modeling provided significant insights into the sales patterns of the fast food chain. The model successfully captured seasonal trends and was effective in forecasting future sales. These insights can assist in making informed decisions for inventory management, staffing, and marketing strategies.

## Future Work
Further analysis could explore more sophisticated models like SARIMA or Prophet for improved forecasting accuracy. Additionally, external factors such as economic indicators or marketing campaigns could be integrated into the model to examine their impact on sales.
